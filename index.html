					From Root to Vase: The Flower Industry

					<p>Ever wonder how perfectly spruced flowers arrive at your local flower shop even in the dead of winter? The journey behind the stems you buy your loved one on Valentine's Day or the daffodils you buy your mother this May is one you might not expect.</p> </br>

						<p>The cut flowers industry is a large, global machiene that generates more than $5.7 billion in the U.S. each year. Over the past few years, however, this industry has begun to wither â€” and local plant growers are facing competition from cheaper, imported flowers from all over the world. Each year, more and more of the United States' most popular flowers are grown in other corners of the globe.</p>

			<p>Once flowers arrive in the U.S., their journey still isn't over. Giant freight trucks ship them all over the country and they wind up in supermarkets and flower shops. The florists who make their living off of the delicate commodity face a tough outlook. With continued external pressure and lower industry profit, traditional florists will likely continue to exit the industry. IBISWorld estimates that the number of establishments will decrease at an average rate of 1.2% per year to 34,069 over the five years to 2020. </p>
